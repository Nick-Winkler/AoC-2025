# Advent of Code 2025 Solutions

This repo contains my attempts at solving the Advent of Code (AoC) 2025 programming challenges. It also includes the notes I took as I was reading through the challenge and planning out the logic/design.

I didn't include the challenge texts or the specific inputs I was given from the site, as per request by the creator of AoC. I do include some of the test data that I used to test my applications though. All solutions are be buildable and runable from the solution directory without modification.

You can find information about AoC and the 2025 challenges at [https://adventofcode.com/2025](https://adventofcode.com/2025)
